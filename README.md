# TTCP-for-IOT
Based on Reliable Wireless Sensor Networks Topology Control for Critical Internet of Things Applications by Dina Deif and Yasser Gadallah.
One of the important topics that have been extensively studied in the Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) literature is Temporal Topology Control (TTC). TTC is used as a
tool to manage the sleep/wake cycles of sensor nodes (SNs) in dense WSNs (i.e. WSNs characterized by a high level of SN redundancy), whether deployed in a planned or a random fashion. The primary objectives of existing TTC protocols
(TTCPs) are maximizing WSN lifetime and minimizing packet collision in the network.
